myArray = [];
myArray.push("Kristie Desiree Zheng", "DelicatelySweet");

var myInfo;

def cutName(name)
{
    explode
}



First, declare a variable named myArray and assign it to an empty array.
    Great! Now populate myArray with two strings.
    Put your full name in the first string, and your Skype handle in the second.

    Next, declare a function named cutName. It should expect a parameter name.
    cutName should return an array by breaking up the input string into individual words.
    Example: cutName("Douglas Crockford") should return ["Douglas", "Crockford"]
Example: cutName("John B. Smith") should return ["John", "B.", "Smith"]
Declare a new variable named myInfo and assign it to an empty object literal.
    Add the following three key-value pairs to myInfo:
    Key: fullName
Value: The result of calling cutName on the name string within myArray.
    Key: skype
Value: The Skype handle within myArray.
    Key: github
Value: If you have a github handle, enter it here as a string. If not, set this to null instead.
